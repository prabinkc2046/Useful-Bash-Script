# Useful SysAdmin Scripts

Welcome to the Useful SysAdmin Scripts repository! This repository contains a collection of helpful scripts frequently encountered by system administrators. These scripts automate common tasks and provide solutions to streamline administrative workflows.

## Scripts

1. `create_virtualenv.sh`: This script checks if Python 3 is installed and installs it if necessary. It then sets up a virtual environment based on user input, creating a directory and activating the virtual environment.

> Note: To run the script, use the 'source' command (`source script_name.sh`) to ensure the virtual environment activation persists in the current shell.

## Instructions

Instructions for each script are provided within the comment sections of the respective script files. The comments explain the purpose of the script, how to use it, and any relevant considerations or dependencies.

Please refer to the comments within each script for detailed instructions and usage guidelines.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any additional scripts that you find useful or improvements to existing scripts, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can build a comprehensive collection of scripts to aid sysadmins in their daily tasks.

Happy scripting!
